<p>
<b>Plan</b>: Define the objectives and scope of the image scraper. Determine the websites or sources from which you want to scrape images. Identify the specific types of images or criteria you are interested in capturing. Plan the overall structure and workflow of the scraper.
</p>

<p>
<b>Analyze</b>: Research and analyze the target websites to understand their HTML structure, image tags, and any relevant attributes. Identify the patterns or specific elements that can help locate the images you want to scrape. Consider any potential challenges or limitations, such as anti-scraping measures or restrictions on accessing certain pages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Construct</b>: Implement the image scraper using a suitable programming language and web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. Write the necessary code to fetch the HTML content of the target webpages, parse the HTML to locate the image tags, extract the image URLs, and download the images. Handle any error handling, pagination, or authentication requirements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Execute</b>: Run the image scraper on the selected websites or sources. Monitor the scraping process to ensure it is functioning correctly and extracting the desired images. Adjust and optimize the scraper as needed based on the results and feedback. Keep track of any challenges or issues encountered during the execution phase.
